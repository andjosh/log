What about, instead of using something like jrnl to record entries and such, you made an empty git repo, then make a special .gitconfig for it that allowed you to only make empty commits, then you just abstracted the jrnl commands into little shell commands in that repo
then you would just be recording things in commits and you could share it between people and you would just search through the commit history
maybe different branches can represent different topics
Encourages you to make short, little journal entries like committing!
set commit to --allow-empty
set syntax highliting to markdown in vim
